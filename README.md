This is a site replication of the clothing website madewell.com. 

## Technologies Used ###

- CSS3  
- HTML5 

## About the Build ### 

I wanted to work on my CSS skills by generating a clean, modern clothing shopping website. It was straightforward to put together. I referenced what is currently on [madewell.com](https://www.madewell.com) to put the site together. Some of the images I could had the text baked in witht he image using a photo editing tool, so I found similar looking images online and added text with HTML5 and CSS3. 

### Issues to solve ###
The actual Madewell site is static when you adjust the size. I would like to make mine fully mobile ready since most people shop on a mobile device. I will need to put in some media queries to make things adjust as the screen size adjusts.
